The future of energy lies in renewable sources, which offer clean and unlimited power. In contrast to fossil fuels, renewable energy like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power does not emit harmful pollutants into the air. Solar energy captures the power of the sun, while wind turbines utilize the wind to generate electricity. Additionally, hydroelectric plants rely on the flow of water to produce energy. Shifting towards renewable energy sources decreases dependence on non-renewable resources and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, making it essential for fighting climate change.
